We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.\n\n\ufffd\ufffd2\ufffd\ufffd History\n\nThe first half of the principal manuscript told a very peculiar tale. It appears that on 1 March 1925, a thin, dark young man of neurotic and excited aspect had called upon Professor Angell bearing the singular clay bas-relief, which was then exceedingly damp and fresh. His card bore the name of Henry Anthony Wilcox, and my uncle had recognized him as the youngest son of an excellent family slightly known to him, who had latterly been studying sculpture at the Rhode Island School of Design and living alone at the Fleur-de-Lys Building near that institution. Wilcox was a precocious youth of known genius but great eccentricity, and had from childhood excited attention through the strange stories and odd dreams he was in the habit of relating. He called himself \"psychically hypersensitive\", but the staid folk of the ancient commercial city dismissed him as merely \"queer\". Never mingling much with his kind, he had dropped gradually from social visibility, and was now known only to a small group of aesthetes from other towns. Even the Providence Art Club, anxious to preserve its conservatism, had found him quite hopeless.\n\n\ufffd\ufffd2\ufffd\ufffd Geography\n\n\ufffd\ufffd3\ufffd\ufffd Mountains of Madness\n\nThis was all, together with the picture of the hellish image; but what a train of ideas it started in my mind! Here were new treasuries of data on the Cthulhu Cult, and evidence that it had strange interests at sea as well as on land. What motive prompted the hybrid crew to order back the Emma as they sailed about with their hideous idol? What was the unknown island on which six of the Emma's crew had died, and about which the mate Johansen was so secretive? What had the vice-admiralty's investigation brought out, and what was known of the noxious cult in Dunedin? And most marvelous of all, what deep and more than natural linkage of dates was this which gave a malign and now undeniable significance to the various turns of events so carefully noted by my uncle?\n\n\ufffd\ufffd2\ufffd\ufffd Lulz\n\nIt was a simple, rambling thing\u2014a naive sailor's effort at a post-facto diary\u2014and strove to recall day by day that last awful voyage. I cannot attempt to transcribe it verbatim in all its cloudiness and redundance, but I will tell its gist enough to show why the sound of the water against the vessel's sides became so unendurable to me that I stopped my ears with cotton.","fullurl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu","editurl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cthulhu&action=edit"}}}}

The company was founded in 1917 in Nuremberg by Fritz Neumeyer, together with the Friedrich Krupp AG and the machine tool manufacturer Thiel under the name \"Z\u00fcnder- und Apparatebau G.m.b.H.\" as a producer of detonators. In 1919, as the demand for weapons parts declined after the First World War, Neumeyer became the sole proprietor of the company, and two years later he diversified into the construction of motorcycles. The company folded in 1984.\nThe first Z\u00fcndapp motorcycle was the model Z22 in 1921. This was the Motorrad f\u00fcr Jedermann (\"motorcycle for everyone\"), a simple and reliable design that was produced in large series. Z\u00fcndapp's history of heavy motorcycles began in 1933 with the K-series. The \"K\" stands for \"Kardanantrieb\", i.e. enclosed driveshaft with two universal joints, the type of drivetrain that these models used. They introduced the enclosed engine case, a novelty at the time. The series encompassed models from 200 to 800\u00a0cc displacement and was a major success, increasing Z\u00fcndapp's market share in Germany from 5% in 1931 to 18% in 1937.\n\nFrom 1931 Ferdinand Porsche and Z\u00fcndapp developed the prototype Auto f\u00fcr Jedermann (\"car for everyone\"), which was the first time the name \"Volkswagen\" was used. Porsche preferred the 4-cylinder flat engine, but Z\u00fcndapp used a water-cooled 5-cylinder radial engine. In 1932 three prototypes were running. All three cars were lost during the war, the last in 1945 in Stuttgart during a bombing raid.\n\nFrom 1936 to 1938 Z\u00fcndapp produced the KKS500 model. This was the first Z\u00fcndapp with a foot gearchange, and 170 examples were built. From 1940 onwards Z\u00fcndapp produced more than 18,000 units of the Z\u00fcndapp KS 750. This is a sidecar outfit with a driven side wheel and a locking differential, supplied to the German Wehrmacht.\n\nAfter the Second World War the company gradually shifted to producing smaller machines, notably the \"Bella\" motor scooter, which was, however, a relatively heavy machine for its type. In 1951 Z\u00fcndapp released the last of its heavy motorcycle models, but also one of its most famous: the KS601 (the \"green elephant\") with a 598\u00a0cc two-cylinder engine. From 1957 to 1958 the company also produced the Z\u00fcndapp Janus microcar.\n\nIn 1958 the company moved from Nuremberg to Munich. Subsequently, the company developed several new smaller models, discontinued the development of four-stroke engines and only produced two-stroke models. Initially, Z\u00fcndapp scooters and mopeds sold well, but later sales declined and in 1984 the company went bankrupt and closed.\n\nAfter the bankruptcy, the entire production line and intellectual properties was bought by Xunda Motor Co., Tianjin, China. They produced small Z\u00fcndapp motorcycles from 1987 till early 1990s. Zundapp is still in business, but makes Honda based 4-stroke motorcycles and electric mopeds. \nZ\u00fcndapp also had a technical collaboration with Enfield India to build mopeds and motorcycles. A dedicated factory was built at Ranipet near Chennai in early 1980\u2019s to manufacture small, lightweight two-stroke motorcycles to be offered along with their flagship Royal Enfield Bullet. Enfield launched two 50\u00a0cc motorcycles first,the step- thru Silver Plus and the 3-speed Explorer motorcycle. Later, 175\u00a0cc Enfield Fury (based on Z\u00fcndapp KS175) was introduced as a performance motorcycle. It had 5-speed gearbox, a hydraulic Brembo disc brake and a sleeveless hard chromed cylinder barrel, all were a first on a motorcycle in that country.\n\n\ufffd\ufffd2\ufffd\ufffd See also\n\nBMW (motorcycles)\n\u010cezeta\nHeinkel\nMaico\nMZ Motorrad- und Zweiradwerk GmbH\n\n\ufffd\ufffd2\ufffd\ufffd References\n\n\ufffd\ufffd2\ufffd\ufffd External links\nZundapp at the Open Directory Project\nFilm\u00a0: Z\u00fcndapp Z 200 - Subtitels: Deutsch & Engisch - production: www.OldtimerbazaR.pl"}}}}
