Vumi Wikipedia App
==================

This is a vumi[1] app that provides access to Wikipedia over a combination of
SMS and USSD.

To install:

    virtualenv --no-site-packages ve
    source ./ve/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.pip
    pip install -e .


NOTE: vumi 0.3.1 (the current stable release) is too old for this app, and the
      dev branch in github has a problem with one of its deps. There are some
      workarounds for this in the requirements.pip file.
